	in associative-commutative {(AC)} and associative-commutative-idempotent
	{(ACI)} equational theories. In most cases of {AC} unification and
	in all cases of {ACI} unification our method obviates the need for
	solving diophantine equations, and thus avoids one of the bottlenecks
	of other associative-commutative unification techniques. The algorithm
	efficiently utilizes powerful constraints to eliminate much of the
	search involved in generating valid substitutions. Moreover, it is
	able to generate solutions lazily, enabling its use in an {SLD-resolution-based}
	environment like Prolog. We have found the method to run much faster
	and use less space than other associative-commutative unification
	procedures on many commonly encountered {AC} problems.},

	of the component theories are non-disjoint. We also describe some

	theories. A sort is represented by a set of monadic predicates, called
	sort symbols. Sorts are attached to variables restricting their respective
	domain to the intersection of the denotations of the sort symbols.
	A sort theory consists of a set of declarations that are atoms starting
	with a sort symbol. Two terms are unifiable with respect to some
	sort theory, if they are unifiable in the standard sense and the
	assignments of the unifier do respect the declarations in the sort
	theory. Therefore, the new sorted unification algorithm is formed
	by standard unification augmented by extra rules that consider the
	information in the sort theory. We prove the new sorted unification
	algorithm to be correct and complete and establish complexity results
	for several different, syntactically characterized sort theories.
	The notions of a sort and a sort theory are developed in such a way
	that sort symbols are used like ordinary monadic predicate symbols.
	To this end, sorts may denote empty sets, and the sort theory is
	not a static part of the signature. It may dynamically change during
	a deduction process. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated
	for the resolution and the tableau calculus.},
